            <h2>Informational</h2>
            <p>
                An informational website is a type of website designed to share key information about an organization, acting like a digital brochure. Its primary goal is visibility, ensuring prospective clients can find details about the business online. Common sections include a homepage, about page, and contact page, often covering the "who, what, where, when, and why" of the organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                These websites typically feature simple content like text, images, audio, and video, without complex functions like user logins or online shopping. They also reflect the organization’s branding through consistent design elements such as logos, fonts, and colors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Informational websites are popular among small businesses and non-profits, serving to educate and inform visitors. Keeping the content up to date is crucial, ensuring accuracy in details like business hours or services. Wikipedia is a prime example of a large informational website.

            <h2>Sales</h2>
            <p>  to sell something. These websites guide visitors through a "sales funnel," a step-by-step journey from discovering a product to deciding to buy it.

                A typical sales website structure includes:
                <ul>
                <li>Introduction: Presents the product in an enticing way.
                <li>Problem/Solution: Highlights a customer pain point and positions the product as the ideal solution.</li>
                    <li>Benefits & Details: Clearly outlines what the product offers.</li>
                    <li>Social Proof: Includes testimonials or quotes from past customers to build trust.</li>
                    <li>Conversion Area: The section where the visitor takes action, like making a purchase, turning them into a buyer.</li>
            </ul>
  
            
                The page often has "buy now" buttons throughout for those ready to purchase quickly. The website's success is measured by its "conversion rate" — the percentage of visitors who complete the desired action. Low conversion rates aren’t uncommon and usually mean the page needs improvement, like refining copywriting to make the sales message more effective.

            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>  
                A portfolio website is an online hub that showcases a person’s or business’s work, acting as a digital resume. It’s especially popular with visual professionals like photographers, designers, and architects, often featuring image galleries to display their projects. Writers, journalists, speakers, and actors also use portfolio sites to share written work, videos, case studies, and testimonials.

                The main goals are to present expertise and increase online discoverability. To optimize performance, images should be compressed for faster loading, and videos should be embedded from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo. Many portfolios use website templates for easy setup, but personalizing fonts, colors, and layout helps make the site unique and memorable.

            <h2>Ecommerce</h2>
            <p> Ecommerce websites are rapidly growing and involve selling products or services online. They can range from simple setups, like selling ebooks or event tickets, to complex online stores with product categories, options, shopping carts, and checkout processes. Building an online store takes time, and many people seek professional help, though DIY options exist.

                 <p id="includes"><span>Key considerations include: </span></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Security:</b> Ensure the site uses HTTPS for secure transactions.  
                    <li> <b>Payment Gateways:</b> Automate payment processing to avoid handling credit card info manually, and compare processing fees to pick the best option.  
                    <li> <b>Integrations:</b> Plan for digital systems to communicate, like linking sales data to bookkeeping or email marketing tools. 
                </ul> 
            
                Proper planning around these factors will make building and managing an ecommerce site much smoother

            <h2>Editorial</h2>
            <p> Online magazines, newspapers, blogs, and editorial websites focus on regularly updated content. Blogs started as online diaries but have evolved into sophisticated platforms, sometimes forming part of larger websites. They display posts in reverse chronological order and are great for sharing news, insights, and boosting search engine optimization (SEO). 

                Editorial websites, like digital newspapers or magazines, go further by organizing content into categories, authors, dates, or tags, making it easier for readers to find specific articles. When building these sites, it’s important to keep the structure simple and user-friendly. 
            
                Choosing the right platform depends on complexity. Basic website builders work for simple blogs, but for more advanced features like content classification and sorting, WordPress is a popular choice.</p>
